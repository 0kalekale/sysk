PROJECT SYSK : set of libraries and programs for kalekale by kalekale

read bin/README and lib/README for more info. 
everything is and will be licensed under AGPL3, however that may change in the future. 
this is a long term project, may take years to reach a stable point (some libraries and some program may be usable early on)
note: if you dont see any commits in months im probably just on a break

codebase is a mess as of right now, no proper build system or uniform program formatting. 

plans:
build system: kcompile (my own builder src:/bin/core/kcompile) 
pure C11 for libraries and programs (C2x when it hits)

major programs:
	- everything in /bin/core (*nix utils)
	- lambdadelta compiler (my own language, POC transpiler to C WIP, will start work on the compiler once I have the specs down)
	- a very linux-like wayland window manager (we have cunnywm but it uses X as of right now)
major libraries:
	- libkinet, http/s and irc/s client server libraries 
	- libsysk, layer on top of the C language for sysk programs
	- libkmk, fast and easy to use math kernel for intel cpus 

once the lambdadelta compiler is done newer programs will be written in lambdadelta 
libraries will still be written in C11
