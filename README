PROJECT SYSK : set of libraries and programs for kalekale by kalekale

read bin/README and lib/README for more info. 
everything is and will be licensed under AGPL3, however that may change in the future. 
this is a long term project, may take years to reach a stable point (some libraries and some program may be usable early on)
note: if you dont see any commits in months im probably just on a break

codebase is a mess as of right now, no proper build system or uniform program formatting. 

future plan:
build system: meson 
libraries will only be written in C11, python wrappers will exist 
for GUI intermediate library like nuklear will be used 
once the lambdadelta compiler is done newer programs will be written in lambdadelta 
libraries will still be written in C11
