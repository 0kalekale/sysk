pillar of project sysk

i. as simple and easy as possible
ii. very customizable + easy to make themes 
iii. C11 with libX11 (maybe wayland if things workout)

must have features:
- embeddeding any opengl/(vulkan?) programs, including libmpv 
- video playing (with libmpv)
- audio playing (with libmpv or libav)
- text writer (for my ultimate IDE)
- menus buttons layouts and the basic gui stuff 

themeing: 
	/usr/share/libktk/themes/sample 
	sample/ will contain grahpics and scripts which will be standardized 
	programs will be able to force themes  
	fancy window border themes 
	floating widgets
