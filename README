PROJECT SYSK : set of libraries and programs for kalekale by kalekale

everything is and will be licensed under AGPL3, however that may change in the future. 
this is a long term project, may take years to reach a stable point (some libraries and some program may be usable early on)
note: if you dont see any commits in months im probably just on a break

codebase is a mess as of right now, no proper build system or uniform program formatting.
