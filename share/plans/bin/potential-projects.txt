ritzdevelop - ritsu development environment for C, Python3, Rust with pip, make, cmake, ninja, meson, cargo and git support based on ritzdit [depends upon libktk, ritzdit, syskst]
cunnyWM2 - cunnywm but based on libktk (or some other name) [depends upon libktk]

lambdadelta - continue developing project lambdadelta under project sysk (compiled language either to either raw x86_64,  qbe or llvm) [depends on me not being incompetent]
ritzscript - simple  scripting language, interpreter written in lambdadelta [depends on lambdadelta]

in the distant future(if i am willing to put in the effort to maintain a new distro):
	ritzpkg (based on the x package) - unix package manager in lambdadelta  
	systemK OS - with GNU coreutils, Linux Kernel, GLIBC, runit, cunnyWM2, and ktk programs
